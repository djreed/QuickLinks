# QuickLinks

Does the internet ever feel _too fast_ for you?

Do you hate that webpages work on the first try?

Download QuickLinks! The only browser extension guaranteed to increase your web-browsing annoyance by a marginal amount.

100ms out of every second, each link on the page will be inactive, forcing you to _sometimes_ navigate a second time.
